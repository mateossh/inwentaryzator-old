IDEA:
User creates/has database with products, do the stocktaking, exports stocktaking
to pdf and prints it.

actions on products database:
- viewing [done]
- adding [done]
- updating [partialy done - name and measure unit gets updated, price don't]
- deleting [done]

actions on stocktaking database:
- viewing [done]
- adding [done]
- updating [done]
- deleting [done]



BUGS:
- updating product in products database doesn't work correctly



TODO
- add raport options
- - page numbers in footer (left, center, right)
- [AddProductWizard in stocktaking] user should be able to look for product by name
- error handling
- add ability to export current Stocktaking to json and download for safety
- add importing data from "O.G Inwentaryzator"

- mDNS in backend ?????? ?????????????????????????????????????/

- edit manifest.json
- save current view to localStorage



NOTES:
- dev mode doesn't work if you don't install react and redux dev tools extensions

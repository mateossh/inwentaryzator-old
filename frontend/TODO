IDEA:
User creates/has database with products, do the stocktaking, exports stocktaking
to pdf and prints it.

actions on products database:
- viewing [done]
- adding [done]
- updating [done]
- deleting [done]

actions on stocktaking database:
- viewing [done]
- adding [done]
- updating [done]
- deleting [done]

BUGS:
- there's no default radio value in pdf generation settings

TODO:
- refactor whole PDF generation thingy
- use memoization
- error handling
- [AddProductWizard in stocktaking] user should be able to look for product by name
- add ability to export current Stocktaking to json and download for safety
- add importing data from "O.G Inwentaryzator"

- edit manifest.json
- save current view to localStorage
- create docker-compose

NOTES:
- dev mode doesn't work if you don't install react and redux dev tools extensions
